# Drug-disease link classification using knowledge graph

This notebook contains scripts to predict if a drug treats a disease using a knowledge graph and graph convolution network.

# How to run it?

### 1. Create conda environment

```
Conda create -n py310-torch python=3.10
conda activate  py310-torch
```
### 2. Install Latest PyTorch
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

```

### 3. Install other libraries

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you created the conda environment and installed the libraries, you can launch the **Classifier-notebook.ipynb** notebook. Then follow the steps in the notebook. Make sure to copy "Embeddings.csv" and "Ground Truth.csv" files to **data/** folder.

The output directory contains model artefacts and evaluation metrics for directed and un-directed graph. These results can be generated by running the notebook.
